<strong>What's a Living Ticket?</strong> This production continues our <a href="http://www.fluxtheatre.org/living-ticket/">Living Ticket</a> initiative, which makes Flux's shows free for all to attend. Well, not exactly free: it costs a lot to create these productions, and we want to provide our team a living wage. So while you don't have to pay anything, we encourage you to support Flux with a donation when you reserve your Living Ticket. To learn what it would take for us to pay a living wage, check out our <a href="http://www.fluxtheatre.org/am-i-dead-open-book-and-living-ticket-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Book</a> program, which shares our production budget and suggests levels of giving.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin R. Free’s </span><b><i>AM I DEAD? The Untrue Narrative of Anatomical Lewis, The Slave</i></b> is a re-imagining of the Isis-Osiris myth in which four strangers from different times are trapped in purgatory, tasked with rebuilding the lives of men they wronged in life. It confronts our country’s long history of violence on black bodies, and examines blackness, and whiteness, in unflinching, theatrical, and caustically funny ways. <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">AM I DEAD?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the second play to come out of Flux’s </span><a href="http://www.fluxtheatre.org/2015/02/meet-fluxforward-playwrights/"><b>FluxForward</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the Adam Szymkowicz’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marian</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year.</span>

<b>Corey Allen </b>is<em><strong> Lewis</strong></em>

<strong>If you were in a purgatory where you had to relive your history in order to change it, what would you relive? What would you change?</strong><em> If I had the hindsight of a whole life, I'd probably want to explore my earliest self-betrayal. I'd want to change any moment where I waffled between what I knew to be right and what I suspected someone else expected of me.</em>

<strong>Name an ancestor you carry with you, and a sentence or two about why. </strong><em>My Grandmother, BMT. She loved unconditionally and made tremendous sacrifices for her children and grandchildren. I like to believe my educational accomplishments and getting to do the work I do is the fulfillment of her dream that we who came after her would live fuller lives with more opportunities than she was afforded.</em>

<b>Lori E. Parquet </b>is <b><i>Isis</i></b>

<strong>If you were in a purgatory where you had to relive your history in order to change it, what would you relive? What would you change?</strong><em> I would definitely be reliving every moment I didn't stand in my truth but in self-doubt and fear.  I suffered greatly as a result. And maybe my making a different decision wouldn't have kept me from suffering, but something tells me I would closer to living the life I dreamed of if I had.</em>

<strong>Name an ancestor you carry with you, and a sentence or two about why.  </strong><em>I think often of my paternal grandmother. I never met her, as she passed away before I was gone. But from what I've seen of her, she was a beautiful woman, with what I imagine was an intensely complicated inner world. I carry that of her in me.</em>

<strong>Name an ancestor you carry with you, and a sentence or two about why.  </strong><em>My grandpa on my mom's side - Virgil Arseneau. He was such a wonderful supportive presence in my life, had a "the more the merrier" attitude, and after I moved to New York City, every time I would come home he'd always make sure to tell me how proud he was of me for following my artistic dreams here.

<strong>Isaiah Tanenbaum</strong> is <b><i>Isaac</i></b>

<strong>If you were in a purgatory where you had to relive your history in order to change it, what would you relive? What would you change? </strong><em>See the thing is that the parts of my history that I'd most want to change are also the parts of my history that I'd LEAST LIKE to visit. So, like, middle school and high school and certain romantic decisions my younger, dumber self made. But I don't think I could possibly want to relive any of that. I guess, like, that one time I ordered a chicken sandwich at the airport and was super sick the whole weekend, because OF COURSE I was. I wish I had ordered from some other place.</em>

<strong>Name an ancestor you carry with you, and a sentence or two about why. </strong><em>My great-grandfather and namesake Isaac Bloom, who was a butcher in Baltimore. During the Great Depression, he organized a series of communal funds to purchase whole animals, which is much cheaper than buying individual cuts. In this way, even the poorest members of the community were able to afford fresh meat. I like to think that the Living Ticket is a continuation of this sort of work -- a whole community of people pitching in to make sure that everyone can enjoy theatre, regardless of financial status.</em>

<strong>Name an ancestor you carry with you, and a sentence or two about why.</strong><em> My paternal grandmother. We never met in person but we share a face and a body - in that every thing about me resembles her. I'm told I even walk like her.

<strong>Bio:</strong> Nissy Aya is a Black girl from the Bronx. She and all her younger selves tell stories and tall tales. A writer, educator, cultural worker and organizer who believes in the transformative nature of storytelling and sees theatre as a tool to create social change by empowering disenfranchised communities to unapologetically portray their whole selves on stage. She is a trained facilitator on topics surrounding the intersections of identity, power and privilege and how those intersections influence structures of oppression. As an artist, her work centers the voices of Black women, explores the lines between history and memory and details both the presence and absence of love.

</strong>

<strong>If you were in a purgatory where you had to relive your history in order to change it, what would you relive? What would you change?</strong> <em>In third grade, I was fascinated with a Mormon girl who didn't pledge allegiance, and so I wrote a story about her and shared it with the class. I still feel regret for how I Othered her in that moment, and I remember the principle calling me into his office to understand my intentions in writing it. I think that was the beginning of my understanding of the real power of stories, how they wound as often as heal, and what that means for our responsibilities as story-tellers. </em>

<strong>Name an ancestor you carry with you, and a sentence or two about why. </strong><em>My great-great-great-great grandmother Mercena, who was a care-giver to the afflicted in her community, and who is the namesake of my daughter.</em>

<strong>Moesha Perez, <em>Costume Assistant/Wardrobe:</em>
</strong>

<strong>If you were in a purgatory where you had to relive your history in order to change it, what would you relive? What would you change?</strong> <em>Just to be a comfortable in your own skin and believe in yourself. You'll go a long way if you continue to have a positive mindset. </em>

<strong>Bio:</strong> I am currently in a three year (second year so far) program through Roundabout Theatre Company called Technical Workforce Development Program (TWDP) which they train you in most aspects of technical theatre that's including wardrobe, Audio, lighting, carpentry, and scenic. I came into the program open to learn but I already knew my focus was wardrobe/ design and hair/ makeup because I was already doing so before the program. I'm grateful because it's a push in the door for the career I want to take.
