Chester is a longtime collaborator with Flux,Â  acting in productions like <em>Jane the Plain, </em>and we'll be presenting a reading of Chester's play <em>The Belle</em> later this year<em>. </em>We asked Chester a few questions based on Montserrat Mendez's dizzyingly funny and brilliant new play, which you can learn more about <a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/2025/01/rebecca-roman-redd-at-the-most-dangerous-hour/">here</a>.

<strong>On a scale of 1 to werewolf, how close of a relationship do you have with the moon</strong>?

<strong>Finish the sentence: the best kind of tart is a ____ tart.</strong>

Chocolate.

<strong>Who did you end up stuck with when the pandemic first struck...and how did that go?</strong>

My dog Pepper. Went pretty well, I think.

<strong>Chester Poon</strong> (he/him): After a very very very long hiatus from theater, I'm very excited to return to the theater world!
