Julianna has become one of Flux's most important collaborators over the past few years, and we can't wait! We asked them a few questions based on Rebecca Ana Peña's powerful new play, which you can learn more about <a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/2025/04/join-us-for-aves-autta-ino-mel-by-rebecca-ana-pena/">here</a>.

<strong>Let’s say you decide to establish a new religion: what or who would you put at the center?</strong>

Food. We all need it but when you eat something comforting or nostalgic or even disgusting, you’re connecting with those around you.

<strong>What do you do when you need to express some rage?</strong>

<span data-sheets-root="1">Have you ever made a feminine rage playlist and tried strutting to it on a treadmill? God tier experience.</span>

<strong>Tell me something wonderful about girlhood (either from experience, or observation).</strong>

The way that detail oriented care is naturally built into friendships. We fix a hair out of place, or tuck a tag in, or give that wildly specific gift.

<strong>Julianna MacKenzie Kantor</strong> (she/they) is a New York based queer theatre artist from Charlotte, North Carolina. She’s passionate about companies and projects that emphasize accessibility in the arts, advocacy and social justice, and development of new works. To learn more about their acting, directing, writing, teaching, and props designing check out @julianna_kantor on Instagram. They’d like to thank Flux for letting her explore her endless modes of squiredom as well as being a space of friendship, creative connection, and supportive mentorship she can count on.
