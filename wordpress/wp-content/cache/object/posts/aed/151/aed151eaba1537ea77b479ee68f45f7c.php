The creative team for this workshop brought Flux Creative Partners Jason Tseng and Emily HartfordÂ  together again as a playwright-director team, after their work on our 2016 production of <a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/History/rizing/"><em>Rizing</em></a>, as well as bringing familiar Flux faces to the table like Lori Elizabeth Parquet (Dramaturg), Chris Wight (Musician), Ned Hartford (Vocal Director) and Chester Poon (U/S Jabez).

We were also thrilled to be working with several new faces on this project. Sam Im (Jabez), Neil Tyrone Pritchard (Ryan), and Tanika Baptiste (Transition Minsiter), with Caren Celine Morris (Stage Manager) and Julianna Kantor (Assistant Director) joining the table.

SYNOPSIS: In a forbidden love story, Jabez and Ryan, two boys of color, navigate a Christian summer camp together in the early 2000s. Their friendship quickly grows into a budding romance that they try to keep alive after returning home. Challenged by their parents, the hazards of landline phones, and their faith, they are forced to secrecy. Finding solace in each other and their shared love of music, theology, and Harry Potter; the reality of living in between two worlds threaten to keep them apart as they navigate their blossoming queer identities and teenage angst in their conservative faith communities.

Fluxâ€™s <a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/foodsoul/">Food:Soul</a> series breaks the mold of traditional staged readings by developing community through developing plays. Our extreme staged reading model gives the artists and audiences a taste of the excitement of a full production, and the potluck dinner that surrounds it frames the play as a free, communal event.
