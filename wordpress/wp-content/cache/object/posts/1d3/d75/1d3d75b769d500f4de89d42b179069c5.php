<p style="text-align: center;">‚ÄúWhoever‚Äôs gonna be co-chair has to be the kind of person who knows their boundaries well enough to be like, listen, I‚Äôm really feeling very burnt out‚Ä¶I need to give myself permission to lay down my burden. Because that‚Äôs how you close the burnout cycle, is to actually give a second to be like, I‚Äôm gonna let it all down for a second, so I can rest long enough that I have the energy to pick it back up.‚Äù
-Ryan Shen</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">‚ÄúThis kind of organizing work, I think the rhythm of it and the sociality of it‚Äîthe relationship building is really what drives it. And when you just boil it down to, like, the logistics of the work itself, something really feels like it‚Äôs missing.‚Äù
