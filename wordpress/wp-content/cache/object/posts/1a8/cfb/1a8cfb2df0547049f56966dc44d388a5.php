<strong>Have you ever felt the boundaries between worlds grow thin? If so, please share a little about that experience.</strong>

In transitionary spaces where the planes of reality and unreality meet, one cannot escape without being altered by both. Dreams, Graveyards, Crossroads, the Internet, your Childhood bedroom which your parents renovated... My understanding is that our perception of time, memory, and reality become confused in these transition spaces. Remember to step lightly... for you are a guest, and something else lives here now. The trick is to remember you can never truly go back.

<strong>Where's a place you go when you need to go away?</strong>

A melancholic waterfront always does the trick.

<strong>What's something meaningful you've learned from an elder?</strong>

"Every conversation with your mother, will Always, be a conversation with your Mother."

<strong>What's something meaningful you've learned from a younger?</strong>

"Uh oh..... Thats okay! We can fix it."
