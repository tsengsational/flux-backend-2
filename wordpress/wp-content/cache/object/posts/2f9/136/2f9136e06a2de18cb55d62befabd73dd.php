In October 2024, after a year-long process, Flux revised our mission statement. The revised mission emerged from sustained conversations about how Flux and the world have changed since we reached consensus on our last mission statement in 2010. It took rituals and story circles, Google Docs and chart paper, community conversations and collective prophecy. We hope you'll join us celebrating and manifesting this new vision over our next decades together!

We also honor our past mission statement, which served us well over fourteen years. It is the soil from which our new mission has grown:
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Flux's mission from 2010-24: "Flux Theatre Ensemble produces transformative theatre that explores and awakens the capacity for change. As an ensemble-artist driven company, we believe that long-term collaboration and rigorous creative development can unite artists and audiences to build a creative home in New York."</p>

<h4>More About Us</h4>
Since 2006, Flux has produced over 30 full productions and hundreds of readings and developmental projects. The ensemble is led by fifteen Creative Partners (CPs) who practice shared leadership through consensus-based decision-making, collectively held resources and labor, and artistic collaboration. There are no fixed executive or artistic director positions. Instead, CPs move in to and out of leadership roles depending on the project, with other CPs consenting to those temporary roles. In this way, the power of leadership is not fixed and exploitative, but rather relational and abundant‚Äîa resource we all contribute to and draw from. Flux is the proud recipient of the 2011 Caffe Cino Fellowship Award, presented annually to an Off-Off-Broadway theatre company that consistently produces outstanding work. The company‚Äôs productions of <em>Hearts Like Fists</em> and <em>Ajax in Iraq</em> were chosen as ‚ÄúNew York Times Critics‚Äô Picks‚Äù and in 2015 Backstage named Flux one of ‚Äúeight young and mighty New York theatre companies.‚Äù Over the years, Flux has received New York Innovative Theatre Award nominations for their productions of <em>Once Upon a Bride There Was a Forest, Jane the Plain, Sans Merci, Hearts Like Fists, Ajax in Iraq, The Angel Eaters Trilogy, The Lesser Seductions of History, Dog Act, Rizing,</em> and <em>Operating Systems</em>.
