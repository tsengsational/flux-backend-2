<strong>On a scale of 1 to werewolf, how close of a relationship do you have with the moon</strong>?

Oh, I love the moon. It's kind of silly how every time I look up and see the moon, I'm like, "Wow! Look at you! There you are." Of course, her real name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet)#:~:text=Theia%20(%2F%CB%88%CE%B8i%CB%90%C9%99,coalescing%20to%20form%20the%20Moon.">Theia</a>, and just because she's now gravitationally bound to Earth doesn't mean she should only call her Moon. Yeah, I have long, extended daydreams of what it'd be like to live on Theia. I'd love to see an Earthrise. But, for now, I'd rather we spend our resources on getting in right relationship with Earth. It's the right place for love, after all.

<strong>Finish the sentence: the best kind of tart is a ____ tart</strong>.

Savory.

<strong>Who did you end up stuck with when the pandemic first struck...and how did that go</strong>?

Heather and Mercena, my wife and daughter. Remote work while simultaneously managing remote school was not easy! At the same time I think we're closer than we would've otherwise been because of that extended, intense proximity. Now that my work is permanently remote, I can work from a park or playground while Mercena plays, and that's a real gift. I just wish it didn't take a pandemic for even the smallest improvement of work/life balance.

<strong>If you were a Billy Carver book, what would your title be?</strong>

<em>Corinna Schulenburg and the Fabulous Trans Uprising.</em>

<strong>Where can we follow your work? </strong>Best place is the Flux website, really. I'm trying to reduce the attention I give the platforms of creepy billionaires.
