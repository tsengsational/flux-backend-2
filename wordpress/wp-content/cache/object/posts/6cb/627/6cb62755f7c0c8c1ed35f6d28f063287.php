<strong>Have you ever felt the boundaries between worlds grow thin? If so, please share a little about that experience.</strong>

I mean, yeah, circa 1998 in Haight-Ashbury I grasped the full nature of the space-time continuum in a blazing instant...but I can't really get into the details of how that happened.

<strong>Where's a place you go when you need to go away?</strong>

There's a spot on the north bank of the Piscataqua River in Portsmouth NH that I would retreat to when I was growing up when I needed catch my breath. It's hidden away behind some buildings but you could hear activity all around and watch the boats float on by. I've always liked places that were little bubbles of calm amidst a bustle of humanity.

<strong>What's something meaningful you've learned from an elder?</strong>

It's important to pay attention to the details (no matter how much you don't enjoy scrubbing the whitewalls of your dad's beloved purple MG with steel wool).

<strong>What's something meaningful you've learned from a younger?</strong>

If you want to really entertain your siblings at the expense of an adult, try quickly sliding your fingers down the crack of their buttocks while yelling CREDIT CARD SWIPE! at the top of your lungs. Do this repeatedly until physically restrained; it only gets funnier with each repetition.

<strong>Chris Wight </strong>(he/him) is a Creative Partner with Flux, most recently appearing in their production of Corey Allen's absurdist play Polly. He is also a longtime artistic member of the renowned Ensemble Studio Theatre.
