<strong>THE STORY:</strong> After Warren proposes to Josie, she decides she must make one last attempt to find her long-lost father before she walks down the aisle. What she finds instead is a dangerous, seductive world of secrets and magic from which she may not want to escape. ONCE UPON A BRIDE THERE WAS A FOREST is a lyrical, haunting and surprisingly funny fairy tale about children and parents, forgetting and remembering, and the power of a good story to capture us or set us free. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/392146054272602/" target="_blank">RSVP on Facebook</a>.
