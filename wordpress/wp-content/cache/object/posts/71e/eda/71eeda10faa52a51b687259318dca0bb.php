Does it heal or harm us? Must artists suffer? What’s the price of so-called ‘genius?’”<br /><br />Then, the audience will watch a series of short films from Corey and team. The films deepen the inquiry into the questions above, taking inspiration from the works of four seminal Black artists: James Baldwin, Beauford Delaney, Nina Simone, and Julius Eastman.

<p><strong>Dubem</strong> (<em>Methods in Madness</em>, Guest Respondent, he/him), Igbo for "Guide Me", is a multidisciplinary artist from Oklahoma, blending music, theatre, still and moving imagery, and cultural storytelling. As a first-generation Igbo American representing Onitsha Ado and Duncan, Oklahoma, Dubem's work bridges the African diaspora and his Indigenous mixed race identity, drawing from his heritage to create genre-spanning soundscapes influenced by artists like Bob Marley, Omou Sangaré, Emily King, Björk and other artists, as well as his own vision of musical theater. In the Brooklyn Arts District, Dubem has performed as an actor at BAM in Kevin Spacey’s Richard’s Rampage and the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Caesar. At Theatre for a New Audience, he appeared in Arin Arbus' King Lear and The Killer starring Michael Shannon. His time working on Kwame Kwei-Armah’s Marley at Baltimore's Center Stage, a musical about the life of Bob Marley, left a lasting impact, particularly during the Baltimore uprising after Freddie Gray’s murder, heightening his understanding of theater’s immediacy in times of social unrest. Dubem has also spent considerable time immersing himself in the local music community between Brooklyn and Harlem, and Harlem to Houston, where he has been encouraged in his songwriting process by artists like Zamy Maa, T'nah (T'nah Apex), Ignabu (Cinque Ubangi Kemp), Bria Monét, Kingsley Ibeneche, Billzegypt, and M3CCA from Houston. In 2019, he worked with JOJO ABOT, which was an immersive dive into interdisciplinary art, further shaping his creative process. His work focuses on healing and cultural reconnection through art.</p>
