SYNOPSIS: At the first, the Seams are a curiosityâ€”strange physical anomalies a world away from where young Eola and her mothers live. But when Seams start opening up nearby, they escape the city with another family to live in the woods until it all blows over. Only...it doesn't blow over. As the two families adapt to a world where the rules are rapidly shifting, Eola's uncanny relationship to the Seams may hold the key to what's next.";s:10:"post_title";s:79:"Come to <em>The Ether</em>, a Zoom reading of a new play by Corinna Schulenburg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:69:"come-to-the-ether-a-zoom-reading-of-a-new-play-by-corinna-schulenburg";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2025-02-26 20:09:12";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2025-02-26 20:09:12";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:36:"https://www.fluxtheatre.org/?p=11563";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}s:15:"key_version_all";i:2;}
