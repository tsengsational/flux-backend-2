Corey was the playwright and Lead Artist of <a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/History/methods-in-madness/"><em>Methods in Madness </em>and <em>Polly, a dumbshow for smart people desperate to survive the fallout</em></a> at The Brick last November, and if you witnessed either or both, you probably miss wandering through that gorgeous art with Corey's voice in your ear as much as we do. We asked Corey a few questions based on Corinna Schulenburg's haunting new play, which you can learn more about <a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/2025/02/come-to-the-ether-a-zoom-reading-of-a-new-play-by-corinna-schulenburg/">here</a>.

<strong>Have you ever felt the boundaries between worlds grow thin? If so, please share a little about that experience.</strong>

There have been moments, often on the edges of exhaustion, when reality has felt less like a fixed state and more like a membrane—thin, shifting, blurring. I think I’ve experienced this several times during long solo drives across the country. Usually at night, hours deep into the road, when time seemed to unravel and the landscape felt both endless and immediate. The sky and horizon blurring, stretching so wide it felt like I could slip right through it. I wasn’t sure if I was moving forward or if the coming night was enveloping me.

<strong>Where's a place you go when you need to go away?</strong>

The cinema. Preferably mid day when few people are there. It's a magical escape.

<strong>What's something meaningful you've learned from an elder?</strong>

Acknowledge that most people who love you are doing so to best of their ability.

<strong>What's something meaningful you've learned from a younger?</strong>

Sometimes it takes a new perspective to see something clearly.
