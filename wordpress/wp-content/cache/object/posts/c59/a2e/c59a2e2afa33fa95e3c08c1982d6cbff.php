This is our first collaboration with Kimberly, and we can't wait! We asked her a few questions based on Rebecca Ana Peña's powerful new play, which you can learn more about <a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/2025/04/join-us-for-aves-autta-ino-mel-by-rebecca-ana-pena/">here</a>.

<strong>What do you do when you need to express some rage?</strong>

I move my body! For me, going for a run or getting into a studio and dancing are the best ways to release rage.

<strong>Tell me something wonderful about girlhood (either from experience, or observation).</strong>

The magic of girlhood lies in the small things - sharing secrets at sleepovers, dancing in my bedroom with my sister, forming a girl group with my best friends. Bonding with other girls during girlhood allowed me to not feel so alone in my experiences, brought me lots of unfiltered joy, inspired me to dream big, taught me how to be a good friend, and gave me a community to lean on during hard times.

<strong>If you had the power to glimpse the future, would you? What would you try to see?</strong>

No - I find it hard enough to be present to begin with, and I feel like taking a glimpse into the future wouldn’t make it any easier.

<strong>Do you have anything else coming up that our creative kin should see?</strong>

I'm going to be in a production of <em>Machinal</em> this summer off-Broadway. I'm playing Telephone Girl, and I'm also the Associate Choreographer.
