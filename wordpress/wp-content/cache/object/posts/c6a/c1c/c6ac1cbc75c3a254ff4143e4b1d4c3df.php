<strong>Let’s say you decide to establish a new religion: what or who would you put at the center?</strong>

We could do worse than worship the ocean.

<strong>Tell me something wonderful about girlhood (either from experience, or observation).</strong>

The best memories of girlhood feel like wildness to me--that time when it was easy to remain a little bit feral. Disappearing on bikes down forest trails, plucking crayfish out of the stream, spending the summer building up callouses from a few months spent barefoot… (Grown-Girl Summer Camp, anyone??)

<strong>If you had the power to glimpse the future, would you? What would you try to see?</strong>

It doesn't seem to go well in the myths...maybe best to steer clear!

<strong>Anything coming up you want to tell us about?</strong>
