Sarah has become an essential collaborator in Flux's Core Work and is one of the generative artists of Portal Project. We asked Sarah a few questions based on Corinna Schulenburg's haunting new play, which you can learn more about <a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/2025/02/come-to-the-ether-a-zoom-reading-of-a-new-play-by-corinna-schulenburg/">here</a>.

<strong>Have you ever felt the boundaries between worlds grow thin? If so, please share a little about that experience.</strong>

Yes. I find all transcendental moments to be where the walls grow thin. I remember watching my grandfather when he was actively dying, snoring away like he always did when he slept, as my cousins were putting together photo posters of him for the impending memorial service. That was a doozy. Also a more rated R answer is that I find highest forms of sexual gratification to feel like I'm being shunted out to a different plane of existence, or at least grazing my fingers on the door of it.

<strong>Where's a place you go when you need to go away?</strong>

I lay on the floor with my dog! Or, if I can, swimming in the warm ocean or being in the Pacific Northwest forest is incredible.

<strong>What's something meaningful you've learned from an elder?</strong>

You will never stop having new experiences, and you will never stop growing.

<strong>What's something meaningful you've learned from a younger?</strong>

I work with youngers almost every day. Their insight, joy, and courage inspire me to be my best self.
