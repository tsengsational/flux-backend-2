<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<p>The year is 2045. Despite lip service toward climate action, the fossil fuel industry continues to thrive. Shit's bad. The rich choose to ignore it, insulated in air-conditioned Bubble communities and continuing to reap the benefits of disaster capitalism. But in a roadside bar on the Outside, a movement of collective power is brewing. A group of revolutionaries-a journalist, a hedge fund manager, and an ancient tree nymph-are tapping into a mythic and elemental magic that will demand that the powerful break the cycle of destruction, or face its consequences.</p>

<h3>REVIEWS</h3>
<p>"<em>Metra</em> posits the interrelation of individual and large-scale stories of transformation. The narrative of what scholar Jason Moore terms the Capitalocene, the era of capitalism's extraction and exploitation of both labor and natural resources, is a tale of transformation as well, albeit an apocalyptic one. This tale is one that the revolutionaries of <em>Metra</em> would like to see replaced, along with the hierarchies of race and gender that capitalism helps to maintain, with a new story...If Metra took the place of something like The Lion King on Broadway, we'd all be better off. " —<a href="https://www.thinkingtheaternyc.com/2022/11/review-looking-to-burst-some-bubbles.html"><em>Thinking Theater NYC</em></a></p>
<p>"The potency of <em>Metra</em> is in its spillage onto the streets, its seepage into your awareness as audiences reintegrate into reality at the conclusion of an epic (in both the Grecian and sci-fi sense) two hours. Walking out to blaring sirens on trash-strewn streets next to artificial, glorified indoor foliage meant to lure LES gentrifiers, the wealth and environmental disparity of a present-day context is inescapable...For <em>Metra</em>, the myth and might of human history and creation prove the play really is the thing." -<a href="https://broadwaydnablog.substack.com/p/metra"><em>Broadway DNA</em></a></p>
<p>“Flux Theatre Ensemble draws on a wild amalgam of Greek myth, glam rock, time travel, comedy, and dystopian projection to envision both despair and an inkling of hope, with METRA, a brash, impactful fantasia by Emily and Ned Hartford.”—<em><a href="https://blogcritics.org/theater-review-nyc-metra-climate-revolution-play-songs-flux-theatre/?">Blogcritics</a></em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Flux's production of <em>Metra</em> is a part of Stop the Money Pipeline coalition's Blame Wall Street project: <a href="https://blamewallstreet.org/">https://blamewallstreet.org/</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Just like the climate revolutionaries of <em>Metra,</em> the Blame Wall Street project is taking action to stop those who are most profiting from our planet's production. As they put it: "Wall Street fuels climate chaos by investing trillions in coal, oil &amp; gas. It’s time to stop them. This fall, we’re calling for a wave of actions that lay the blame for the climate crisis on those responsible: the banks, insurers &amp; investors funding the fossil fuel industry."</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://stopthemoneypipeline.com/stop-funding-fossil-fuels/">TAKE ACTION HERE</a>. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Please join Flux and the cast and creative team of <em>Metra</em> in taking climate action with the <a href="https://stopthemoneypipeline.com/">Stop the Money Pipeline coalition</a> and <a href="https://blamewallstreet.org/">Blame Wall Street</a>!</p>

<h3><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></h3>
<p class="">The themes for <em>Metra</em> were originally conceived and developed through a series of devising workshops in 2018, led by Emily Hartford, that were funded by the Puffin Foundation. That grant enabled an ensemble of artists gather and experiment with the source dramaturgy, generate material, and engage in dramaturgical discussion. Following those workshops, Ned Hartford and Emily Hartford created the script for <em>Metra</em> (with songs by Ned Hartford). <em>Metra </em>had its first full table read in September 2019. In addition to the Puffin Foundation support, <em>Metra </em>has received development support through Flux Theatre Ensemble’s Annual Retreat, as well as Flux’s new-work incubator, Core Work.</p>
<p class="">Artists who participated in the devising and development above have included Toni Anderson, Arthur Aulisi, Rocio Mendez, Antonio Miniño, Lori Elizabeth Parquet, Anna Rahn, Dominique Rider, Corinna Schulenburg, Ereni Sevasti, and Stephanie Willing.</p>
