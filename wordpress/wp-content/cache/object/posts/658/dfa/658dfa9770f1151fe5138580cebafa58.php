<strong>THE STORY:</strong> In the not-too-distant future, the pressure to cure a global pandemic spurs the creation of DEINDE, a device that allows a team of brilliant quantum biologists to think directly into a powerful computer. At first, they use this prosthetic for the mind under strict rules of engagement, but soon noble ideals and personal passions lead a few to break the rules. They discover that DEINDE’s power is far greater than anyone first imagined, and their world spins out of control, raising questions of morality, consciousness, and what it means to be human in an age of rapid technological change.

DEINDE is presented as part of <a href="http://www.bfgcollective.com/" target="_blank">The BFG Collective</a> at The Secret Theatre with <a href="http://www.boomerangtheatre.org/boom/index2.php" target="_blank">Boomerang Theatre Company</a> and <a href="http://www.gideonth.com/" target="_blank">Gideon Productions</a>.

[one_half]
<blockquote>Director Heather Cohn has realized the play with insight and simplicity, aided immeasurably by a stellar cast and an excellent design team....<em>DEINDE</em> is one of the smartest, sharpest, and most important new plays of the theatre season. This is the kind of work that the deep-pocketed nonprofit institutions that dominate our theatre ought to be looking for and mounting, and I'm proud to be calling attention to it any way that I can.</blockquote>

[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<blockquote>A complex and engaging new play that satisfies both brain hemispheres....The set's plexiglass aesthetic (cleanly designed by Will Lowry) assists in the fluidity of the narrative and offers an appropriate sterility to the lab. For science geeks and others, <em>DEINDE</em> is a clever amalgamation of science fiction and theatre.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In <em>DEINDE</em>, Schulenburg explores technology, relationships, that old standby hubris, and, oh yeah, the meaning of life. That's a lot to cover in a two-act play, and he does it with humor, compassion, and some gorgeous dialogue.</blockquote>

[/one_half]
[one_half_last]
<blockquote>Something wonderful is happening at the Secret Theater. Science fiction has taken over this Long Island City that’s begun to play host to a series of intellectually stimulating pulp theater, starting with Mac Rogers’ ongoing Honeycomb Trilogy with Gideon Productions there. Now, the provocative cyber-thriller Deinde joins the ranks as well. Who’d have thought such a small Off-Off-Broadway venue could provide such fertile soil for the sandbox of one’s mind?</blockquote>

[/one_half_last]

<blockquote>...the masterful staging of layering three different scenes into one room, so that we swing from sickbed to laboratory to break room, creates stirring contrast between these friends and competitors, even as the self-made gods begin to struggle against their restraints.</blockquote>
–Natalie Zutter, TOR.com (<a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/deinde-theater-review" target="_blank">read full review</a>)
[/one_half]
[one_half_last]
<blockquote>The play, which is put on by Flux Theatre Ensemble, is engaging for its humor, its rich characters and the actors who bring them to life, and for the complex and chilling inquiries into how we define being human as technology becomes an increasingly prevalent force in our lives.</blockquote>
–Matthew Taylor, BORO Mag (<a href="http://boromag.com/featured/deinde-at-the-secret-theatre/" target="_blank">read full review</a>)
[/one_half_last]
[one_half]
<blockquote>Schulenburg does a good job of establishing his nerd cred in a scene referring to the Star Trek episode where Picard learns to play the Ressikan flute...The playwright also shows that he’s put a great deal of thought into how enhanced intelligence would affect human culture. What sort of poetry, music or humor would appeal to these mental ubermen? Schulenburg goes into each of these matters in impressive detail.</blockquote>
–Charles Battersby, Theater for Nerds (<a href="http://theaterfornerds.com/?p=83" target="_blank">read full review</a>)
[/one_half]
[one_half_last]
<blockquote>DEINDE explores these themes through the time-honored tropes of artificial intelligence and the terrors of unbridled tech, matched with clever dialogue and soul-searching ruminations on life and love. Produced in our time of iPhones and SIRI, DEINDE feels prescient, as well as connected to science fiction's past.</blockquote>
