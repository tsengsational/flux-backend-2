Justin has become an essential collaborator in Flux's Core Work and is one of the generative artists of Portal Project. We asked Justin a few questions based on Corinna Schulenburg's haunting new play, which you can learn more about <a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/2025/02/come-to-the-ether-a-zoom-reading-of-a-new-play-by-corinna-schulenburg/">here</a>.

<strong>Have you ever felt the boundaries between worlds grow thin? If so, please share a little about that experience.</strong>

Can't say I have. I'm pretty sure that this world is the one we're stuck with, and we have to make the most of it. Even in moments of extreme grief and profound joy, I feel more OF this world than separate from it.

"I donâ€™t like to travel because Iâ€™ve noticed
no matter where you go,
you take yourself with you,
and thatâ€™s the only thing I care to leave behind."

"Ode to Elizabeth," by Joe Weil

<strong>Where's a place you go when you need to go away?</strong>

It's not where I go so much as what I do. I write something for one of a half dozen projects I'm working on, or I pick up my guitar.

<strong>What's something meaningful you've learned from an elder?</strong>

Regarding grief - "The pain never goes away, but it lessens over time." - Helen Woo, my paternal grandmother, who lost her son, daughter, and husband before the age of 70.

<strong>What's something meaningful you've learned from a younger?</strong>

"Sometimes it's good to just sit down and look around at all the beautiful things in the world." - my nephew Nathan Kulawiak, age 5, gazing at the colorful signs at a strip mall in Edison, NJ
