Thank you to everyone who attendedÂ <em>What She Left Us</em> by Kristen Palmer, directed by Heather Cohn!
<p dir="ltr">We were so thrilled to return to <a href="https://www.kristenpalmerplaywright.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kristenpalmerplaywright.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726427806386000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1J3iQiRjM1JwCNyLIeBER6">Kristen Palmerâ€™s</a>Â powerful theatrical imagination. You may remember our full production and Food:Soul workshop of Kristenâ€™sÂ <em><a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/History/upon-bride-forest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fluxtheatre.org/History/upon-bride-forest/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726427806386000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2h4vUJEQ9e7q_R45X4X4M5">Once Upon a Bride There Was a Forest</a></em>, but Kristenâ€™s work hasÂ <a href="https://www.fluxtheatre.org/tag/kristen-palmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fluxtheatre.org/tag/kristen-palmer/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726427806386000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1djXXc8N-_r6Lm4JfoW2-d">also appeared</a> at multiple Have Anothers, Flux Sundays, Core Works, and Annual Retreats. Flux Creative Partner Heather Cohn was the director of Bride and many of Kristenâ€™s other Flux collaborations, so this was a true reunion!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Weâ€™re also thrilled to welcome Flux collaborators, old and new. In addition to Creative PartnerÂ Chris WightÂ and longtime Flux collaboratorÂ Jane Lincoln TaylorÂ (<em>Rattlers, Jacobâ€™s House)</em>, this reading featured two <em>Metra</em> alums in Rebecca Ana PeÃ±a and Allison Cachay Narva (ASM),Â <em>Portal Project</em> collaborator Emily Rondon as stage manager, and newcomers Donovan MonzÃ³n-Sanders and Kelley Rae Oâ€™Donnell rounded out the cast, along with real-life father-daughter team, David and Emma DelGrosso (very fitting for this play about family).</p>

SYNOPSIS: Mati calls her grown children home to be with her as she dies. She has meaning to convey and has constructed artifacts in a final attempt to bridge the gaps in her communication. Will they grasp this and what will they understand from her attempt?
